# LightBnB
A simple, multi-page AirBnB clone which uses server-side JavaScript to display information from queries to web pages via SQL queries. This project is part of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp program, and the initial set up code can be found [here] (https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/LightBnB_WebApp). 

# Project Outcomes

In this project, I learned how to:

- Design the database and create an ERD for the tables.
- Create the database and the tables using the ERD.
- Add data to the database to make testing queries easier.
- Write queries.
- Connect the database to a JavaScript application in order to interact with the data from a web page.
