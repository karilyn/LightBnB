# LightBnB
A simple, multi-page AirBnB clone which uses server-side JavaScript to display information from queries to web pages via SQL queries. This project is part of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp program, and the initial set up code can be found [here] (https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/LightBnB_WebApp).
