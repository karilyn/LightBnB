# LightBnB
A simple, multi-page AirBnB clone which uses server-side JavaScript to display information from queries to web pages via SQL queries. This project is part of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp program, and the initial set up code can be found [here](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/LightBnB_WebApp). 

# Project Outcomes

In this project, I:

- Designed the database and create an ERD for the tables.
- Created the database and the tables using the ERD.
- Added data to the database to make testing queries easier.
- Wrote queries.
- Connected the database to a JavaScript application in order to interact with the data from a web page.

In completing this project, I learned to:

- Explain the importance and application of SQL/relational databases for web applications.
- Describe the key components that make up a relational database.
- Design database tables using primary and foreign keys correctly.
- Determine if a data model should use one-to-many or many-to-many relationships when designing relational databases.
- Utilize SELECT statements to solve common data query questions involving GROUP BY, WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER.
- Utilize CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE statements to modify existing database table structure and records.
- Use JOIN statements to combine information from related tables to build more complex result sets.
- Use asynchronous (promise-based) postgres JS libraries to query data from Node applications.
- Use the psql CLI to interact with and explore a database.
- Research database queries through documentation and other references.

By completing this project, I was preparing myself to do the following on the job:

- Troubleshoot and debug problems associated with web development.
- Demonstrate problem solving skills by developing basic algorithms to solve coding challenges or katas.
- Evaluate or analyze coding solutions / ideas, and their limitations and/or benefits.
- Contribute to full-stack web applications using modern software development patterns, tools and workflows.
- Contribute to the backend of web applications that use industry-standard languages (Ruby) and frameworks (Rails and Express).
- Integrate into common development team workflows (git, github workflow, automated testing, and code reviews).
- Extend existing database design, as well as writing realistic SQL queries to CRUD data in SQL databases.
- Create API services and/or consumers that use modern data formats such as JSON.

# Project Features

A user can: 
- create an account and then login and logout
- Search properties using a variety of dynamic search parameters
- Create a new listing
- View their own listings and reservations

# Installation Instructions

1. Clone the project into your terminal and install dependencies using `npm install`. 
2. Start the web server in LightBnB_WebApp-master using the `npm run local` command. 
3. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser or set your own host using your own environment variables.
